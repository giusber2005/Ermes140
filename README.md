Ermes140 is a cli program written in c related with audios.
With this program you'll be able to record, compress, export audio, to remove noise from them, to reproduce them from the cli and to identify notes from them.
You will be also able to create multiple profiles, to manage your library of audios and notes files, and to see the audio you record and reproduce in a nice graphical cli program.
